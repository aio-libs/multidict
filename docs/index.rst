multidict
=========

Multidicts are useful for working with HTTP headers, URL
query args etc.

The code was extracted from aiohttp library.

Introduction
------------

*HTTP Headers* and *URL query string* require specific data structure:
*multidict*. It behaves mostly like a regular :class:`dict` but it may have
several *values* for the same *key* and *preserves insertion ordering*.

The *key* is :class:`str` (or :class:`istr` for case-insensitive
dictionaries).

:mod:`multidict` has four multidict classes:
:class:`MultiDict`, :class:`MultiDictProxy`, :class:`CIMultiDict`
and :class:`CIMultiDictProxy`.

Immutable proxies (:class:`MultiDictProxy` and
:class:`CIMultiDictProxy`) provide a dynamic view for the
proxied multidict, the view reflects underlying collection changes. They
implement the :class:`~collections.abc.Mapping` interface.

Regular mutable (:class:`MultiDict` and :class:`CIMultiDict`) classes
implement :class:`~collections.abc.MutableMapping` and allows to change
their own content.


*Case insensitive* (:class:`CIMultiDict` and
:class:`CIMultiDictProxy`) ones assume the *keys* are case
insensitive, e.g.::

   >>> dct = CIMultiDict(key='val')
   >>> 'Key' in dct
   True
   >>> dct['Key']
   'val'

*Keys* should be either :class:`str` or :class:`istr` instance.

The library has optional C Extensions for sake of speed.

Library Installation
--------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install multidict

The library is Python 3 only!

PyPI contains binary wheels for Linux, Windows and MacOS.  If you want to install
``multidict`` on another operation system (or *Alpine Linux* inside a Docker) the
Tarball will be used to compile the library from sources.  It requires C compiler and
Python headers installed.

To skip the compilation please use `MULTIDICT_NO_EXTENSIONS` environment variable,
e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ MULTIDICT_NO_EXTENSIONS=1 pip install multidict

Please note, Pure Python (uncompiled) version is about 20-50 times slower depending on
the usage scenario!!!


Source code
-----------

The project is hosted on GitHub_

Please file an issue on the `bug tracker
<https://github.com/aio-libs/multidict/issues>`_ if you have found a bug
or have some suggestion in order to improve the library.

The library uses `Azure Pipelines <https://dev.azure.com/aio-libs/multidict/_build>`_
for Continuous Integration.
