6.3.1
=====

*(2025-04-01)*


Bug fixes

----


6.3.0
=====

*(2025-03-31)*


Bug fixes
---------

- Set operations for ``KeysView`` and ``ItemsView`` of case-insensitive multidicts and their proxies are processed in case-insensitive manner.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`965`.

- Rewrote :class:`multidict.CIMultiDict` and it proxy to always return
  :class:`multidict.istr` keys. ``istr`` is derived from :class:`str`,
  thus the change is backward compatible.

  The performance boost is about 15% for some operations for C Extension,
  pure Python implementation have got a visible (15% - 230%) speedup as well.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`1097`.

- Fixed a crash when extending a multidict from multidict proxy if C Extensions were used.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`1100`.


Features
--------

- Implemented a custom parser for ``METH_FASTCALL | METH_KEYWORDS`` protocol
  -- by :user:`asvetlov`.

  The patch re-enables fast call protocol in the :py:mod:`multidict` C Extension.

  Speedup is about 25%-30% for the library benchmarks for Python 3.12+.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`1070`.

- The C-extension no longer pre-allocates a Python exception object in
  lookup-related methods of :py:class:`~multidict.MultiDict` when the
  passed-in *key* is not found but *default* value is provided.

  Namely, this affects :py:meth:`MultiDict.getone()
  <multidict.MultiDict.getone>`, :py:meth:`MultiDict.getall()
  <multidict.MultiDict.getall>`, :py:meth:`MultiDict.get()
  <multidict.MultiDict.get>`, :py:meth:`MultiDict.pop()
  <multidict.MultiDict.pop>`, :py:meth:`MultiDict.popone()
  <multidict.MultiDict.popone>`, and :py:meth:`MultiDict.popall()
  <multidict.MultiDict.popall>`.

  Additionally, the :py:class:`~multidict.MultiDict` comparison with
  regular :py:class:`dict`\ ionaries is now about 60% faster
  on Python 3.13+ in the fallback-to-default case.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`1078`.

- Implemented ``__repr__()`` for C Extension classes in C.

  The speedup is about 2.5 times.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`1081`.

- Made C version of :class:`multidict.istr` pickleable.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`1098`.

- Optimized multidict creation and extending / updating if C Extensions are used.

  The speedup is between 25% and 70% depending on the usage scenario.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`1101`.

- :meth:`multidict.MultiDict.popitem` is changed to remove
  the latest entry instead of the first.

  It gives O(1) amortized complexity.

  The standard :meth:`dict.popitem` removes the last entry also.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`1105`.


Contributor-facing changes
--------------------------

- Started running benchmarks for the pure Python implementation in addition to the C implementation -- by :user:`bdraco`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`1092`.

- The the project-wide Codecov_ metric is no longer reported
  via GitHub Checks API. The combined value is not very useful
  because one of the sources (MyPy) cannot reach 100% with the
  current state of the ecosystem. We may want to reconsider in
  the future. Instead, we now have two separate
  “runtime coverage” metrics for library code and tests.
  They are to be kept at 100% at all times.
  And the “type coverage” metric will remain advisory, at a
  lower threshold.

  The default patch metric check is renamed to “runtime”
  to better reflect its semantics. This one will also require
  100% coverage.
  Another “typing” patch coverage metric is now reported
  alongside it. It's considered advisory, just like its
  project counterpart.

  When looking at Codecov_, one will likely want to look at
  MyPy and pytest flags separately. It is usually best to
  avoid looking at the PR pages that sometimes display
  combined coverage incorrectly.

  The change additionally disables the deprecated GitHub
  Annotations integration in Codecov_.

  Finally, the badge coloring range now starts at 100%.

  and later removed in 3.13 -- by :user:`iemelyanov`.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`862`, :issue:`864`, :issue:`868`, :issue:`898`.



- Reverted to using the public argument parsing API
  :c:func:`PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords` under Python 3.12
  -- by :user:`charles-dyfis-net` and :user:`webknjaz`.

  The effect is that this change prevents build failures with
  clang 16.9.6 and gcc-14 reported in :issue:`926`. It also
  fixes a segmentation fault crash caused by passing keyword
  arguments to :py:meth:`MultiDict.getall()
  <multidict.MultiDict.getall>` discovered by :user:`jonaslb`
  and :user:`hroncok` while examining the problem.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*

  a link to the ``Towncrier philosophy`` has been fixed.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`911`.




Packaging updates and notes for downstreams
-------------------------------------------

- Stopped marking all files as installable package data
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`7ba0e72`.


- Switched from ``setuptools``' legacy backend (``setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__``)
  to the modern one (``setuptools.build_meta``) by actually specifying the
  the ``[build-system] build-backend`` option in :file:`pyproject.toml`
  -- by :user:`Jackenmen`.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`802`.



- Declared Python 3.12 supported officially in the
  distribution package metadata -- by :user:`hugovk`.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`877`.




Contributor-facing changes
--------------------------

- The test framework has been refactored. In the previous state, the circular
  imports reported in :issue:`837` caused the C-extension tests to be skipped.

  Now, there is a set of the ``pytest`` fixtures that is set up in a parametrized
  manner allowing to have a consistent way of accessing mirrored ``multidict``
  implementations across all the tests.

  This change also implemented a pair of CLI flags (``--c-extensions`` /
  ``--no-c-extensions``) that allow to explicitly request deselecting the tests
  running against the C-extension.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`98`, :issue:`837`, :issue:`915`.



- Updated the test pins lockfile used in the
  ``cibuildwheel`` test stage -- by :user:`hoodmane`.

  which addresses the following compiler warning:

  .. code-block:: console

     warning: a function declaration without a prototype is deprecated in all versions of C [-Wstrict-prototypes]

  -- by :user:`hoodmane`


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`828`.



- An experimental Python 3.13 job now runs in the CI
  -- :user:`webknjaz`.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`920`.



- Added test coverage for the :ref:`and <python:and>`, :ref:`or
  <python:or>`, :py:obj:`sub <python:object.__sub__>`, and
  :py:obj:`xor <python:object.__xor__>` operators in the
  :file:`multidict/_multidict_base.py` module. It also covers
  :py:data:`NotImplemented` and
  ":py:class:`~typing.Iterable`-but-not-:py:class:`~typing.Set`"
  cases there.

  -- by :user:`a5r0n`


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`936`.



- The version of pytest is now capped below 8, when running MyPy
  against Python 3.7. This pytest release dropped support for

----


6.0.4 (2022-12-24)
==================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed a type annotations regression introduced in v6.0.2 under Python versions <3.10. It was caused by importing certain types only available in newer versions. (:issue:`798`)


6.0.3 (2022-12-03)
==================

Features
--------

- Declared the official support for Python 3.11 — by :user:`mlegner`. (:issue:`872`)


6.0.2 (2022-01-24)
==================

Bugfixes
--------

- Revert :issue:`644`, restore type annotations to as-of 5.2.0 version. (:issue:`688`)


6.0.1 (2022-01-23)
==================

Bugfixes
--------

- Restored back ``MultiDict``, ``CIMultiDict``, ``MultiDictProxy``, and
  ``CIMutiDictProxy`` generic type arguments; they are parameterized by value type, but the
  key type is fixed by container class.

  ``MultiDict[int]`` means ``MutableMultiMapping[str, int]``. The key type of
  ``MultiDict`` is always ``str``, while all str-like keys are accepted by API and
  converted to ``str`` internally.

  The same is true for ``CIMultiDict[int]`` which means ``MutableMultiMapping[istr,
  int]``. str-like keys are accepted but converted to ``istr`` internally. (:issue:`682`)


6.0.0 (2022-01-22)
==================

Features
--------

- Use ``METH_FASTCALL`` where it makes sense.

  ``MultiDict.add()`` is 2.2 times faster now, ``CIMultiDict.add()`` is 1.5 times faster.
  The same boost is applied to ``get*()``, ``setdefault()``, and ``pop*()`` methods. (:issue:`681`)


Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed type annotations for keys of multidict mapping classes. (:issue:`644`)
- Support Multidict[int] for pure-python version.
  ``__class_getitem__`` is already provided by C Extension, making it work with the pure-extension too. (:issue:`678`)


Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- Dropped Python 3.6 support (:issue:`680`)


Misc
----

- :issue:`659`


5.2.0 (2021-10-03)
=====================

Features
--------

- 1. Added support Python 3.10
  2. Started shipping platform-specific wheels with the ``musl`` tag targeting typical Alpine Linux runtimes.
  3. Started shipping platform-specific arm64 wheels for Apple Silicon. (:issue:`629`)


Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed pure-python implementation that used to raise "Dictionary changed during iteration" error when iterated view (``.keys()``, ``.values()`` or ``.items()``) was created before the dictionary's content change. (:issue:`620`)


5.1.0 (2020-12-03)
==================

Features
--------

- Supported ``GenericAliases`` (``MultiDict[str]``) for Python 3.9+
  :issue:`553`


Bugfixes
--------

- Synchronized the declared supported Python versions in ``setup.py`` with actually supported and tested ones.
  :issue:`552`


----


5.0.1 (2020-11-14)
==================

Bugfixes
--------

- Provided x86 Windows wheels
  :issue:`550`


----


5.0.0 (2020-10-12)
==================

Features
--------

- Provided wheels for ``aarch64``, ``i686``, ``ppc64le``, ``s390x`` architectures on Linux
  as well as ``x86_64``.
  :issue:`500`
- Provided wheels for Python 3.9.
  :issue:`534`

Removal
-------

- Dropped Python 3.5 support; Python 3.6 is the minimal supported Python version.

Misc
