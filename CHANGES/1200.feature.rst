Skipped reallocation of internal htkeys structure on inserting new items if the
multidict has deleted items and it could be collapsed in-place.  Removal of
``malloc()``/``free()`` could improve the performance a little.

The change affects C implementation only, pure Python code is not changed.

Patch by :user:`asvetlov`.
