The the project-wide Codecov_ metric is no longer reported
via GitHub Checks API. The combined value is not very useful
because one of the sources (MyPy) cannot reach 100% with the
current state of the ecosystem. We may want to reconsider in
the future. Instead, we now have two separate
“runtime coverage” metrics for library code and tests.
They are to be kept at 100% at all times.
And the “type coverage” metric will remain advisory, at a
lower threshold.

The default patch metric check is renamed to “runtime”
to better reflect its semantics. This one will also require
100% coverage.
Another “typing” patch coverage metric is now reported
alongside it. It's considered advisory, just like its
project counterpart.

When looking at Codecov_, one will likely want to look at
MyPy and pytest flags separately. It is usually best to
avoid looking at the PR pages that sometimes display
combined coverage incorrectly.

The change additionally disables the deprecated GitHub
Annotations integration in Codecov_.

Finally, the badge coloring range now starts at 100%.
