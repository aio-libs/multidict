Restored back ``MultiDict``, ``CIMultiDict``, ``MultiDictProxy``, and
``CIMutiDictProxy`` generic type arguments; they are parametrized by value type, but the
key type is fixed by container class.

``MultiDict[int]`` means ``MutableMultiMapping[str, int]``. The key type of ``MultiDict`` is always ``str``, while all str-like keys are accepted by API and converted to ``str`` internally.

The same is true for ``CIMultiDict[int]`` which means ``MutableMultiMapping[istr, int]``. str-like keys are accepted but converted to ``istr`` internally.
